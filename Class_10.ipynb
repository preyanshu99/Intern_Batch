    "Python too supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e., to read and write files, along with many other file handling options, to operate on files. The concept of file handling has stretched over various other languages, but the implementation is either complicated or lengthy, but alike other concepts of Python, this concept here is also easy and short. Python treats file differently as text or binary and this is important. Each line of code includes a sequence of characters and they form text file. Each line of a file is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line characters like comma {,} or newline character. It ends the current line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun. Let’s start with Reading and Writing files.\n",
    "* Working of open() function\n",
    "We use open () function in Python to open a file in read or write mode. As explained above, open ( ) will return a file object. To return a file object we use open() function along with two arguments, that accepts file name and the mode, whether to read or write. So, the syntax being: open(filename, mode).\n",

    "Here is a list of the different modes of opening a file −\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"r\", Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.\n",
    "* \"rb\", Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.\n",
    "* \"r+\", Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"rb+\", Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.\t\n",
    "* \"w\", Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.\t\n",

    "* \"wb+\", Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.\n",
    "* \"a\", Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.\n",
